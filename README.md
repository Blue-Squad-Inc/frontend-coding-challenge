# Blue Squad Frontend Engineer Coding Challenge

## Objective
- Start by a taking a look at all the mockups provided in the `mockups` directory and then come back to read the rest. 
- Your objective is to implement a webapp that starts at the `login` mockup. Logging in will redirect the user to the dashboard. The dashboard should look like and provide the functionality evident in the `dashboard` mockup. The whole app should be responsive. We've provided a mobile mockup for the dashboard. All http requests will be sent to an api we're hosting @ `https://mock-api.bluesquad.co`. We've provided a postman collection in this repo that contains all the available endpoints that this api has. Explore the api to get a feel for which endpoints need to be leveraged in order to facilitate the expected behavior of the webapp.

## Requirements
- Web-app must be written in React
- No CSS frameworks allowed. Vanilla CSS or JSS only!
- No Redux or mobX. Libraries like `react-query` and `recoil` are allowed.
## Expectations
- We will be looking for certain aspects that haven't been captured in the mockups. This includes the following:
  - Error handling and displaying error messages (e.g. login form)
  - Clean routing
  - Commented code
  - Efficient load times and memory usage
  - Measured component rerending.
  - Measured network i/o. Every request made should have a purpose
  - Extendability. It should be easy to add additional features to your submission

## Submission Instructions
- **We're expecting this coding challenge to take you no more than 1 week from the day you receive it**. Create a github repo, feel free to name it whatever you want. Add everything necessary into that repo along with instructions on how to boot up your submission. Send Shion a link to your repo when you're ready for us to take a look.

## Additional Thoughts
- We've left these instructions to be a little vague because a part of this challenge is you figuring out what to do and how to do it. That said, please don't hesitate to ask questions! We'll let you know if it's something we expect you to figure out on your own :). Good luck and we hope you have fun!
